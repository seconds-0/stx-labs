# Backfill Reference Archive

Legacy deep-dive documents retained for historical context. The active
operational instructions now live in `docs/runbooks/backfill.md`.

| File | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md` | Original discovery write-up covering pagination, schema, and caching decisions. |
| `wallet_backfill_analysis.md` | 10-section technical reference (architecture, cursors, retries). |
| `wallet_backfill_quick_ref.md` | Cheat sheet for key functions/flags. |
| `BACKFILL_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` | Early automation steps; superseded by the runbook and scripts. |
| `BACKFILL_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` | Environment prep checklist (now folded into runbook + AGENTS). |
| `BACKFILL_TMUX_GUIDE.md` | tmux how-to (reduced to a section in the new runbook). |
| `BACKFILL.md` / `README_BACKFILL.md` | Previous canonical docs; kept for reference. |

Feel free to delete or update these once the information is mirrored elsewhere.
