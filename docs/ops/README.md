# Operations Guide

Central home for day-to-day workflow references. Start here before digging into
individual markdown files.

## Contents

- `AGENTS.md` (repo root) – canonical agent + contributor instructions.
- `CLAUDE.md` – model-specific notes (moved here for archival reference).
- `MONITOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` – dashboard + notebook monitoring procedures.
- `worktree-merge-quick-ref.md` – how to manage git worktrees safely.

Future additions:
- Cache hygiene playbook (planned).
- Deployment + publishing SOP.

Please link any new operational docs from this index to avoid scattering
instructions throughout the repo.
