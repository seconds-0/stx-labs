What user scale is needed for developer break-even?\n\n## Developer Cost Structure\n- **Deployment Costs**: Contract deployment fees\n- **Ongoing Costs**: Server infra, API calls, monitoring\n- **Transaction Costs**: Users pay directly vs app subsidizes\n- **Maintenance**: Upgrades, security audits\n- **Opportunity Cost**: Building on Stacks vs Ethereum vs Solana\n\n## Revenue Models to Analyze\n1. **Transaction Fees**: App takes % of each transaction\n2. **Subscriptions**: Monthly/annual access fees\n3. **Protocol Tokens**: Launch token, capture value via governance\n4. **MEV/Arbitrage**: DEX operators, liquidation bots\n5. **NFT Royalties**: Marketplaces, collections\n6. **Service Fees**: sBTC peg operators, stacking pools\n\n## Data Requirements\n- Top Stacks apps by revenue (on-chain + off-chain)\n- Contract deployment and interaction costs\n- User activity metrics per app (DAU, MAU, tx per user)\n- Fee revenue by app category\n- Comparative: Ethereum/Polygon/Solana app economics\n\n## Viability Metrics\n- **Revenue Per User (RPU)**: Annual revenue / MAU\n- **Cost Per User (CPU)**: Gas + infra costs / MAU\n- **Gross Margin**: (Revenue - Variable Costs) / Revenue\n- **Break-even Scale**: Minimum users for profitability\n- **CAC Payback**: User acquisition cost vs LTV\n\n## App Categories to Model\n1. **DEXs**: Trading fees, liquidity provider revenue\n2. **Lending**: Interest spreads, liquidation fees\n3. **NFT Marketplaces**: Platform fees, minting revenue\n4. **sBTC Apps**: Peg fees, wrapped asset services\n5. **Gaming**: In-app purchases, NFT sales\n6. **Stacking Pools**: Management fees on BTC rewards\n\n## Deliverables\n- Developer economics dashboard\n- Break-even analysis by app category\n- Revenue model viability comparison\n- Cost sensitivity scenarios (gas fees, user scale)\n- Recommendations: What Stacks needs to improve dev viability\n\n## Case Studies\n- Profile 3-5 successful Stacks apps\n- Calculate their unit economics\n- Identify what makes them sustainable\n- Document failed/abandoned apps and why\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Model break-even user count for each category\n- Identify most viable revenue models\n- Calculate 'fully loaded cost per user' on Stacks\n- Compare Stacks developer margins to other chains\n- Recommend protocol improvements (fee subsidies, grants)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nPhase 1: Survey existing Stacks apps and categorize\nPhase 2: Build developer_economics.py cost modeling\nPhase 3: Revenue analysis per category\nPhase 4: Case studies of top apps\nPhase 5: Comparative benchmarking\nPhase 6: Viability scenarios and recommendations\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n14-18 days (includes qualitative research)\n\n## Key Output\n'A DeFi app on Stacks needs X MAU at Y transactions/month to break even, assuming Z% take rate. This compares to Ethereum which needs X/3 users due to higher fees but deeper liquidity.'","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-25T20:18:43.506061-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-25T20:20:06.103313-07:00","source_repo":"."}

How does Nakamoto's 5-second blocks impact fee economics?\n2. Does faster throughput increase total fee revenue?\n3. How does congestion pricing work with high throughput?\n4. What's the relationship between block speed and fee per transaction?\n5. Does Nakamoto enable new use cases that drive fees?\n\n## Nakamoto Upgrade Economics\n**Pre-Nakamoto**: ~10 min Bitcoin block = 1 Stacks block = low throughput\n**Post-Nakamoto**: ~10 min Bitcoin block = ~20 Stacks blocks = 20x capacity\n\n**Key Changes**:\n- 5-second block times\n- Fast blocks (interim) + anchor blocks (Bitcoin-finalized)\n- Higher TPS capacity (10-100+ tx/sec vs \u003c1 tx/sec)\n- Lower per-tx congestion (more block space)\n\n## Economic Hypotheses to Test\n1. **Volume Effect**: More capacity → more transactions → higher total fees\n2. **Price Effect**: Less congestion → lower fees per tx → net neutral or negative?\n3. **Use Case Enablement**: Fast blocks unlock real-time apps (gaming, payments)\n4. **Fee Market Dynamics**: How do users bid in fast vs anchor blocks?\n5. **Miner Incentives**: Do fast blocks change miner BTC bid behavior?\n\n## Metrics to Calculate\n- **Pre/Post Comparison**: Fees before and after Nakamoto\n- **Block Utilization**: % of block space used (congestion proxy)\n- **Fee Dynamics**: How fees respond to utilization changes\n- **New Use Cases**: Apps/transactions only viable post-Nakamoto\n- **Throughput Elasticity**: How does usage scale with capacity?\n\n## Data Requirements\n- Transaction volume pre/post Nakamoto (Hiro API)\n- Block times and sizes (fast vs anchor blocks)\n- Fee per transaction trends\n- Congestion metrics (mempool size, block fullness)\n- New app launches post-Nakamoto\n\n## Analysis Components\n1. **Historical Comparison**: Pre-Nakamoto vs Post-Nakamoto fee economics\n2. **Congestion Analysis**: Relationship between utilization and fees\n3. **Use Case Mapping**: Which apps benefit from fast blocks?\n4. **Scenario Modeling**: Fee revenue at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% capacity\n5. **Elasticity Study**: How responsive is demand to increased throughput?\n\n## Deliverables\n- Nakamoto economics dashboard\n- Pre/post comparison of key metrics\n- Congestion pricing curves\n- Use case viability analysis (what became possible?)\n- Capacity utilization forecasts\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Quantify Nakamoto's impact on total fee revenue\n- Identify optimal block utilization for fee maximization\n- Model fee revenue at full Nakamoto capacity utilization\n- List use cases enabled by Nakamoto (gaming, DEX, payments)\n- Recommend capacity expansion strategies (future upgrades)\n\n## Key Questions to Answer\n- Did Nakamoto increase or decrease fee per transaction?\n- Did total fee revenue increase despite lower per-tx fees?\n- What % of Nakamoto's capacity is currently utilized?\n- What would fees look like at 100% utilization?\n- Which new apps contribute most to post-Nakamoto fees?\n\n## Implementation Phases\nPhase 1: Collect pre/post Nakamoto data\nPhase 2: Build throughput_economics.py module\nPhase 3: Congestion and fee market analysis\nPhase 4: Use case impact assessment\nPhase 5: Capacity modeling and scenarios\nPhase 6: Dashboard and strategic recommendations\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n10-14 days\n\n## Critical Insight\n'Nakamoto increased capacity 20x but reduced congestion, resulting in X% lower fees per transaction but Y% higher total fee revenue due to Z% more transactions.
